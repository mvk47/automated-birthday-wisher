# automated-birthday-wisher

At times it can be really difficult to remember all of your friend's birthdays. So we have a solution. I have built a python project that automatically sends birthday greetings to your friends and loved ones. Follow the steps below to execute it:

1. Update your friends names and birthdays in the csv file.
2. Input your mail ID and password into the code where it is asked. (You can pass it as environmental variable in case security is an issue).Make sure the security settings are modified aloowing the email to be sent.
3. Once done you can update the code onto an automatic platform where you can schedule the code run.(I use pythonanywhere to do it).
4. Voila you are done.
